# Introduction to Programming Blockchain

Welcome to Programming Blockchain with Jimmy Song.

### GitHub Permissions [IMPORTANT]
If you read nothing else, read this section. This platform was designed with beginners in mind and because of some of the git magic we take on user's behalf we ask for a _lot_ of permissions when you authenticate with GitHub. Therefore, we strongly suggest you create a new GitHub account for this course. To avoid any confusion you should sign out of GitHub right now if you have an active session. When prompted in the next lesson to OAuth, you can use `your_email+test@gmail.com` as your email and that should be enough to get you a fresh account. We are actively working on moving to a better system that requires less aggressively scopes, but this is a current weakness of Learn.

### In this course

Learn the ins and outs of blockchain development in this interactive 2-day seminar. You will learn the details of how Bitcoin works including live coding challenges to sharpen your skills. In this course you will learn:

  - Finite Fields
  - Elliptic Curves
  - Elliptic Curve Cryptography
  - Signing/Verifying Messages
  - Parsing Transactions
  - Signing/Verifying Transactions
  - Creating Transactions
  - Script parsing and processing
  - Address construction/Private Key WIF Format Construction
  - Parsing Blocks
  - Validating Proof-of-Work
  - Target and Difficulty Calculations
  - Merkle Tree Construction
  - Merkle Proofs
  - Network Message Parsing
  - Segwit
  - Finding a job in Bitcoin Development

Programming Blockchain has been running for many months but it is new to Learn.co so let's take this opportunity to orient you to the platform.

### Learn.co

#### Navigating the curriculum
We provide easy navigation to the next lesson, but if you'd like to go back or jump ahead lessons you can navigate between sections using the curriculum tree in the upper left corner:

#### Running Tests
Learn natively supports Jupyter Notebooks. In previous sessions students download the [pb-exercises repo](https://github.com/jimmysong/pb-exercises) and use the Jupyter Notebooks to manipulate example code and understand concepts, but the tests run by modifying files within the Session X directory. On Learn.co you shouldn't need to leave the notebook as we will run the tests with the blue button seen below and return the output:
![run_tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/intro-to-programming-blockchain-jsong/master/run_tests.png)

We've interspersed many of the test driven exercise (labeled as such) with the coding examples, but if you are looking for the test driven exercises a good rule of thumb is that the stubbed out methods end with a `pass` line. The tests running against the notebook can be found in the `/test` dir in the file `index_test.py`.

#### Looking at the code on GitHub
If you would like to look at the canonical repo you can click on the Octocat icon:
![GitHub Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/intro-to-programming-blockchain-jsong/master/github_icon.png) 

If you replace the `learn-co-students` portion of the url `github.com/learn-co-students/repo-name` with your GitHub username (i.e. `github.com/your_username/repo-name`) you will get you directly to your forked version.
