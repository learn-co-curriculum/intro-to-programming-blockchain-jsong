# Introduction to Programming Blockchain

Welcome to Programming Blockchain with Jimmy Song.

### GitHub Permissions [IMPORTANT]
If you read nothing else, read this section. This platform was designed with beginners in mind and because of some of the git magic we take on user's behalf we ask for a _lot_ of permissions when you authenticate with GitHub. Therefore, we strongly suggest you create a new GitHub account for this course. To avoid any confusion you should sign out of GitHub right now if you have an active session. When prompted in the next lesson to OAuth, you can use alternate email or even `your_email+test@gmail.com` to create a fresh account. We are actively working on moving to a better system that requires less aggressively scopes, but this is a current weakness of Learn.

### In this course

Learn the ins and outs of blockchain development in this interactive 2-day seminar. You will learn the details of how Bitcoin works including live coding challenges to sharpen your skills. In this course you will learn:

  - Finite Fields
  - Elliptic Curves
  - Elliptic Curve Cryptography
  - Signing/Verifying Messages
  - Parsing Transactions
  - Signing/Verifying Transactions
  - Creating Transactions
  - Script parsing and processing
  - Address construction/Private Key WIF Format Construction
  - Parsing Blocks
  - Validating Proof-of-Work
  - Target and Difficulty Calculations
  - Merkle Tree Construction
  - Merkle Proofs
  - Network Message Parsing
  - Segwit
  - Finding a job in Bitcoin Development

Programming Blockchain has been running for many months but it is new to Learn.co so let's take this opportunity to orient you to the platform.

## Learn.co

#### Navigating the curriculum
We provide easy navigation to the next lesson with a button on the right panel below the lights, but if you'd like to go back or jump ahead lessons you can navigate between sections using the curriculum tree in the upper left corner:

#### Running Tests
Programming Bitcoin is a test driven learning approach. In previous Programming Bitcoin classes, students have downloaded the [pb-exercises repo](https://github.com/jimmysong/pb-exercises) and use the Jupyter Notebooks locally to manipulate example code and understand concepts. However, the tests run against other python files in the library, not the notebook itself. Learn.co natively supports Jupyter Notebooks. There won't be a need to have the files locally or leave the notebook. You can run the tests with the blue button labeled Run Test (shown below). If you have failures or errors we will give you a button to view your output underneath the red light on the right panel.

We've interspersed many of the test driven exercises (labeled as such) with the coding examples, but if you are looking for the test driven exercises a good rule of thumb is that the stubbed out methods end with a `pass` line. The tests running against the notebook can be found in the `test/index_test.py` file.

#### Looking at the code on GitHub
If you would like to look at the canonical repository you can click on the Octocat icon:
![GitHub Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/intro-to-programming-blockchain-jsong/master/github_icon.png)

We will be forking all of the Jupyter Notebooks you view, which means you will have access to those repos on your account. When viewing the canonical repository, if you replace the `learn-co-students` portion of the url `github.com/learn-co-students/repo-name` with your GitHub username (`github.com/your_username/repo-name`) you can view your forked version. You can also navigate to your GitHub profile.

#### Solutions
If you are having a hard time solving a lab, we've provided a `solution.ipynb` notebook within the repo that has the answers. Things move pretty quickly during the seminar so don't feel bashful about getting some hints from that notebook.

#### This is new so feedback is very welcome
Hosting Programming Bitcoin on learn is an experiment and so feedback is very welcome. We want to make this as great an experience as possible so please don't be shy with suggestions or raising bugs. It's all appreciated.
